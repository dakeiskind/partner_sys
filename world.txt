In the first half of FY2015, I have met the 72% UR line and had all the UR records filled. I have involved the 'BPM dev. platform' which is an internal innovation project, and acted a role as S.A. in 'Suppliers and partnership portal of CMCC HeBei'. All projects runs well with no negative feedback from neither sales nor customers. Additionally a PMP certification has been got as well.
